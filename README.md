# Passgen

This project is a simple password generator application coded in Java. The motivation behind the
project was for me to use a password manager application that is able to generate secure passwords.
I am aware that this type of applcation already exists in many forms, but I thought the use case
was simple enough for me to create it myself.

The frontend is a TUI (textual user interface) application with menu navigation. The backend is an
API coded with Spring Boot.
